# selenium_webscraper_project
This is a python script created to extract info from a target site. Note: This cannot be used on any random site! It is a webscraper, not a web crawler for God's sakes!
This is a scrapper built using the Python Selenium (--version 4) library.
This scrapper extracts information from the target site given me, transforms the info into a pandas dataframe and returns the cleaned dataframe in .csv format.
